Welcome to CSULA CS1222 Introduction to Relational Databases.  Here are the topics that we will cover for this class.  

![overview](resources/images/plan.png)

This course is based on the Stanford University Database course, with some additional topics.  Note that the primary database system that we will use for this class is
`MySQL`.  Although you can use other DBMS, e.g. `PostgresSQL` or `SQL Server`, however your mileage will vary.

Please refer to the [syllabus](SYLLABUS.md) for more information on the administrative guideline.

Important course news and announcements are posted here, so please check this `README.md` file regularly.

## Announcements

- **5/10/2017** [Study Guide](STUDYGUIDE.md) has been posted.

- **3/21/2017** I've posted [Class Notes](CLASSNOTES.md).  Hopefully this will help you prepare for the midterm.  Once again, the format of the exam is consited of two parts: short answers and progamming.  You can have one note sheet for the short answers part but everything is close.  For the programming part, it's openbook.

- **3/6/2017** Please note that I have to travel conflict with lecture schedule this week.  You will need to watch the following videos:

  - Les Bell's [Creating and Querying a Database Schema with MySQL Workbench](https://youtu.be/EL39BGSUkzw).  This video will give students a more comprehensive tutorial on the various features of a MySQL workbench.

  - Edward Kench's [SQL Outer Joins and Cross Joins Tutorial](https://youtu.be/3t2X1jczt4g).

  - Edward Kench's [SQL Inner Join Multiple Tables with SUM Tutorial](https://youtu.be/NuJn9TVCuK0).

Note that Ed Kench's videos are specific to Microsoft SQL server.  However, we can easily adapt them to MySQL.

- **2/7/2017** I am really sick today -- cannot make it to class.  Therefore, class is canceled.  Please discuss on the gitter if you have questions.

- **1/30/2017** Discussion board is up.  Please visit [https://gitter.im/cs1222-spring-2017/Lobby](https://gitter.im/cs1222-spring-2017/Lobby) for real-time web development excitement.
